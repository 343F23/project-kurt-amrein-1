        <h1>Part 1 Report</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>This is the url to the github repo which is shared to the professor: https://343f23.github.io/project-phase-1-kurt-amrein-1/index.html</li>
            <li>When I tried to join the github classroom it wouldn't let me make a team, so I made my own repository and shared it to the professor from there.</li>
            <li>I published my site to github.</li>
            <li>This is my report.html and it is accessible from the URL root.</li>
            <li>There are five seperate pages: index.html, baseball.html, basketball.html, football.html, and hockey.html.</li>
            <li>There is a header which is the nav bar at the top of the page.</li>
            <li>There are buttons at the top of the page and when you press them it takes you to that page of the website.</li>
            <li>I put comments in my css files to show where it supports distinct layouts for small and large screens. I took away the side images and decreased the size of the text boxes.</li>
            <li>I have two images on both sides of the screen and there is a background image. They all have alt attributes to describe what the image is.</li>
            <li>Each page validates with no errors or warnings from WAVE and Nu validator checks.</li>
            <li>I have two different font faces. For the headings and the name of the website it is in Papyrus, and for the text in the rest of the website is in Georgia.</li>
            <li>I have one form and it is the search bar in the top right of every page.</li>
            <li>I have links to external sites at the bottom right of each page.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Part 2 Report</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>I have one api that finds your timezone and uses that to display a time and date when you make a post.</li>
            <li>I have a media query for each page for a mobile view of the website.</li>
            <li>I use a dropdown for mobile view to go between the pages, I have a navbar at the tap to get to different pages, and I use cards to display the blog post.</li>
            <li>I use localStorage to add post to the site and make sure they stay they after the page is refreshed, and I use it to delete post.</li>
            <li>I do not have a blob</li>
            <li>I have a clear data button that clears all of the post on that web page.</li>
            <li>All of my files validate with no warnings or errors using the Nu Validator and WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator.</li>
